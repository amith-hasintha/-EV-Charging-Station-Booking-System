# EV Charging Station Booking System - Backend API

## Overview
This is a complete ASP.NET Core 8 Web API backend for an EV Charging Station Booking System with MongoDB database and JWT authentication.

## Features
- **User Management** with role-based authorization (Backoffice, Station Operator, EV Owner)
- **Charging Station Management** with AC/DC types and slot management
- **Booking Management** with business rules and QR code generation
- **JWT Authentication & Authorization**
- **MongoDB Integration** with repository pattern
- **Swagger Documentation** with JWT support
- **Centralized Error Handling**
- **Environment Configuration** with .env file
- **Sample Data Seeding**

## Architecture
- **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and responses
- **Services**: Business logic and validation
- **Repositories**: Data access layer
- **Models**: Entity definitions
- **DTOs**: Data transfer objects
- **Config**: Configuration classes
- **Middleware**: Global error handling

## Prerequisites
- .NET 8 SDK
- MongoDB (connection string in .env file)
- Visual Studio or VS Code

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone and Navigate
```bash
cd EVChargingBackend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
dotnet restore
```

### 3. Configure Environment
The `.env` file is already configured with your MongoDB connection string:
```
MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING=mongodb+srv://Amith:Amith123@agroprolk.6cgbg.mongodb.net/EVChargingDB?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=AgroProLK
MONGODB_DATABASE_NAME=EVChargingDB
JWT_KEY=5f8f8c9e-4d3b-4c2a-9f7b-2e5f8f8c9e4d
JWT_ISSUER=EVChargingAPI
JWT_AUDIENCE=EVChargingClients
JWT_EXPIRY_MINUTES=60
```

### 4. Build the Project
```bash
dotnet build
```

### 5. Run the Application
```bash
dotnet run
```

The API will be available at: `http://localhost:5082`
Swagger UI will be accessible at: `http://localhost:5082` (root path)

## Sample Users (Auto-seeded)

## Testing with Swagger

1. Start the application (`dotnet run`)
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:5082`
3. Use the login endpoint with sample credentials
4. Copy the JWT token from the response
5. Click "Authorize" button in Swagger UI
6. Enter: `Bearer <your-jwt-token>`
7. Test the endpoints based on your role

## Sample API Usage

### 1. Login
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@evcharging.com",
  "password": "Admin123!"
}
```

### 2. Create Booking (EV Owner)
```bash
POST /api/bookings
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
{
  "stationId": "<station-id>",
  "startTime": "2025-09-28T10:00:00Z",
